# First-project---AIML
# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project is a simple Machine Learning model built to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using the **Decision Tree algorithm**. It uses the classic [Titanic dataset] which is commonly used for introductory machine learning tasks.
Predict survival outcomes of Titanic passengers using machine learning.
A beginner-friendly classification project using Decision Tree  on the Kaggle Titanic dataset.
